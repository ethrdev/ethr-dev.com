The documentation project for the Poker Scientist app represents a comprehensive guide designed to aid users and developers in navigating and understanding the full capabilities of the app. The documentation is developed using a modern tech stack that includes Next.js, ensuring server-side rendering and static site generation for faster load times and SEO benefits.

Tailwind CSS is employed to craft a customizable and responsive design, allowing the documentation to be easily accessible on any device. Framer Motion adds an extra layer of interactivity with smooth and engaging animations, making the user experience more enjoyable and intuitive.

Zustand, a minimalistic state management tool, is utilized to handle the app's state with simplicity and efficiency, ensuring that the documentation remains dynamic and responsive to user interactions.

Together, these technologies create a user-friendly, informative, and visually appealing documentation site for the Poker Scientist app, making it easier for users to master the app's functionalities and for developers to integrate or build upon its features.
